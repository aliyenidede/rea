# REA

A portable development toolkit that bootstraps a structured Claude Code workflow into any project.

```bash
pip install rea-dev
rea init <project>          # copies slash commands + agents + creates .rea/ dirs
# open Claude Code → /rea-init
```

---

## The problem

Claude Code is powerful but stateless. Each session starts cold: no memory of past decisions, no consistent workflow, no plan files, no branch discipline. You rebuild context every time.

REA solves this by giving Claude a fixed structure to operate inside — the same commands, the same plan format, the same branch rules — across every project and every session.

---

## What it does

REA installs slash commands, composable agents, and a structured plan/log system into your project. The CLI is mechanical — it copies files. All intelligence runs through Claude.

### Commands

```
rea init             → copies .claude/commands/ + .claude/agents/ + creates .rea/
/rea-init            → scans project, installs missing config, sets up GitHub
/rea-plan            → full planning pipeline with interrogation + adversarial review
/rea-execute         → agent-driven implementation with parallel dispatch
/rea-commit          → detects branch, opens PR to correct target
/rea-verify          → health check, reports missing pieces with fix commands
/rea-brainstorm      → collaborative design exploration before planning
/rea-update          → update REA from PyPI + sync templates
/rea-wrap            → session wrap-up — log, lessons, context for next session
/rea-worktree        → isolated git worktree for parallel work
/rea-write-skill     → create new agents or commands
```

### Agents

Agents are composable building blocks that commands orchestrate. Each agent has a single responsibility and can also be called standalone.

| Agent | Model | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| `explorer` | Haiku | Read-only codebase research |
| `implementer` | Sonnet | TDD-driven implementation (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR) |
| `spec-reviewer` | Sonnet | Verifies implementation matches requirements |
| `code-reviewer` | Sonnet | Code quality assessment (SRP, DRY, testability) |
| `debugger` | Sonnet | 4-phase root cause debugging |
| `plan-reviewer` | Sonnet | Adversarial plan review — finds gaps before execution |
| `plan-validator` | Sonnet | Mechanical plan checks — rules, file placement, coverage |
| `dispatcher` | Sonnet | Groups todo items into parallel/sequential batches |
| `bug-scanner` | Sonnet | Logic bugs, edge cases, error handling gaps |
| `security-scanner` | Sonnet | Security vulnerabilities, OWASP top 10 |
| `skill-writer` | Sonnet | Creates new agents or commands matching REA conventions |

## Quickstart

**Requirements:** Python 3.11+, `gh` CLI authenticated (with `workflow` scope), git repo with GitHub remote.

```bash
# 1. Install
pip install rea-dev

# 2. Add REA to your project
rea init /path/to/project

# 3. Open Claude Code in that project and run
/rea-init
```

`/rea-init` detects your stack (Node/pnpm, Python, etc.) and installs:
- `.claude/settings.json` — allowed commands
- `.claude/hooks/post-tool-use.sh` — auto-lint on every file write
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — test + lint on every PR
- `.github/workflows/claude-review.yml` — `@claude` PR review via Anthropic API
- `.gitattributes` — consistent line endings across platforms
- `staging` branch + GitHub branch protection

Required GitHub secrets after setup:
```bash
gh secret set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
gh secret set COOLIFY_STAGING_WEBHOOK_URL    # if using Coolify
gh secret set COOLIFY_PRODUCTION_WEBHOOK_URL # if using Coolify
```

## Plan pipeline

The most important part of REA. Before writing any code, you run:

```
/rea-plan "add stripe billing"
```

Claude doesn't immediately start coding. It:

1. Researches the relevant files and functions in your project
2. Drafts a technical requirements doc — no code, no PM sections
3. Runs an interrogation loop: *"100% sure this plan is right?"* — finds real problems before they hit production
4. Surfaces decisions with trade-offs and waits for your input
5. Runs **adversarial review** via `plan-reviewer` agent — catches gaps, inconsistencies, and unresolved decisions
6. Writes three files to `.rea/plans/0001-stripe-billing/`:
   - `spec.md` — what and why
   - `plan.md` — technical requirements
   - `todo.md` — step-by-step execution with a `NEXT:` marker
7. Creates a log entry in `.rea/log/`

The `NEXT:` marker in `todo.md` marks the first incomplete step. Next session, `/rea-plan` finds it and asks to resume — no re-reading the full plan.

---

## Execution pipeline

After planning, run:

```
/rea-execute
```

The execution pipeline:

1. Loads the active plan and todo list
2. Calls `dispatcher` agent to analyze dependencies and group items into parallel/sequential batches
3. Executes items using `implementer` agent (with TDD: write test → make it pass → refactor)
4. Runs `spec-reviewer` and `code-reviewer` after each batch
5. Loops until all items are complete
6. Detects recurring patterns and suggests new skills via `skill-writer`

---

## Plan file structure

```
.rea/
├── log/
│   └── 2026-03-14-0001-stripe-billing.md
└── plans/
    └── 0001-stripe-billing/
        ├── spec.md    ← what and why
        ├── plan.md    ← technical requirements
        └── todo.md    ← step-by-step with NEXT: marker
```

---

## Branch strategy

```
main      → production
staging   → pre-production
feature/* → PR to staging
hotfix/*  → PR to main
```

`/rea-commit` detects the current branch and opens the PR to the right target automatically.

---

## CLAUDE.md hierarchy

```
~/.claude/CLAUDE.md           ← global rules (all projects)
project/CLAUDE.md             ← project architecture + stack
project/features/x/CLAUDE.md ← feature-specific rules (created by /rea-plan when needed)
```

`/rea-plan` creates a feature-level `CLAUDE.md` when the task opens a new domain (auth, billing, webhooks) or spans multiple sessions.

## REA vs Superpowers

[Superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) is a popular Claude Code plugin that enforces TDD and structured debugging. REA takes a different approach — modular agents and a full project lifecycle.

| Capability | REA | Superpowers |
|---|---|---|
| TDD (red-green-refactor) | Risk-based — mandatory for high-risk, optional for low-risk | Always mandatory |
| Debugging methodology | 4-phase root cause agent (`debugger`) | 4-phase structured debugging |
| Brainstorming | `/rea-brainstorm` → spec → handoff to plan | Socratic brainstorming |
| Planning pipeline | Interrogation loop + adversarial review (`plan-reviewer`) | — |
| Parallel execution | `dispatcher` groups items → concurrent `implementer` agents | — |
| Code review | `code-reviewer` agent with delta coverage check | Built-in code review |
| Spec review | `spec-reviewer` — verifies impl matches requirements | — |
| Self-extending | `/rea-write-skill` — creates new agents/commands | Skill authoring |
| Git worktrees | `/rea-worktree` — isolated parallel branches | — |
| Branch strategy | `feature/*` → staging → main with auto PR targeting | — |
| CI/CD setup | `/rea-init` installs workflows, branch protection, hooks | — |
| Plan persistence | `.rea/plans/` with spec + plan + todo, cross-session resume | — |
| Installation | `pip install` + `rea init` (CLI) | Plugin marketplace |
| Test coverage target | Delta coverage — new code must have tests | 85-95% target |

**TL;DR:** Superpowers focuses on coding discipline (TDD, debugging). REA covers the full lifecycle — from brainstorming through planning, execution, review, and deployment.

## Architecture

```
Commands (orchestrators)          Agents (building blocks)
┌─────────────────────┐          ┌──────────────────────┐
│ /rea-plan           │───calls──│ explorer             │
│                     │───calls──│ plan-reviewer         │
│ /rea-execute        │───calls──│ dispatcher            │
│                     │───calls──│ implementer           │
│                     │───calls──│ spec-reviewer         │
│                     │───calls──│ code-reviewer         │
│                     │───calls──│ skill-writer          │
│ /rea-brainstorm     │───calls──│ explorer             │
│ /rea-write-skill    │───calls──│ skill-writer          │
└─────────────────────┘          └──────────────────────┘

```

Key rule: **agents never call other agents** — only commands orchestrate agent calls.
